		- ShopDataCatalogue.ca line 67
		the thing needs a parent, but it's being not being set because Global variables bluuuuu.
		Fix it soon.

	Previous bug a. was caused because no new items were created, merely referenced by the "new item"
	Applied fix by creating a new function in ItemCatalogue.cs that creates a new item by taking in an ID
		a container, and two objects. One object for the parent of the item, and the second a parent for
		the icon of that item.
	Therefore all previous short term bugs have been dealt with.
	
	New issues:
		a. when the stash panel is closed (and maybe in other cases) all icons (and maybe items) are destroyed
			originally this was intentional and they would be re-created when needed. However, there are instances
			where items/icons should exist but have been destroyed and aren't recreated. Find where items are being 
			destroyed and where they are being told to be made again
		b. find a better method, for example: move the icons around instead of destroying them
		c. party 0 and party 3 seem to be sharing their "PartyIsActive" bool, or something like this.
			When party 0 is sent on an expedition: if 3 is out the message indicating party 0 is busy will display
			and party 0's timer is displaying.
			It looks as though party 3 is getting party 1's values somehow
			This is odd and needs to be fixed soon, so find the cause.
		d. fix c.
		e. the excavation buttons are displaying the "active" party's inventory, which ends up being the same party
			no matter which button is clicked. For now the arrows can still be used to select the correct party to 
			send the loot too, but this can't stay that way, those arrows are going to be disabled eventually on the 
			loot screen. Find the cause for the same party being displayed when the excavation buttons are clicked.
		f. fix e.
		g. Can't remember right now, but there's another pressing issue in the code. Will update when I remember.

Fixes:
	c. is fixed, ironically a. and b. are still issues.
		The Fix: the issue was two scripts were creating the items, and that there was a 
		function call that added items to the "inventory", using items that didn't have
		the correct function delegation
	There was another issue with the items not being added to inventories correctly.
		The issue was that when an item was added to an inventory it was added to all party's 
		inventories. 
		This was fixed by getting and then setting the inventories in script (ChangeContainer),
			since only most places in the script were "getting" the inventories, but the one place
			that needed it most (the funciton that set the items properly at the end), did not.
			Two new functions were made for clarity and the "Get" is called in nearly every other
			function of the script.

		
Short Term issues:
	a. Excavated Items are only being created once, or just the icons are created once
		something like that. Find the cause of the issue.
	b. Fix a.

ChangingContainerScript.cs, just io_CurrentContainer in general, might/should use
	party ID *-2 to identify being in a particular party's stash

Short Term / High Priority goals:
a. excavated items are only showing the one icon again, find the problem
b. fix a.
c. make sure a. isn't also an issue elsewhere, I have a feeling we're only making
	one item and/or icon and just shimmying it around

Icons were "invisible" because they had no Z scale. Problem solved.

Short Term / High Priority goals:
a. Find the issue causing icons to be invisible but also funcitonal
b. Fix issue a.
c. excavated items are only showing the one icon again, find the problem
d. fix c.
e. make sure c. isn't also an issue elsewhere, I have a feeling we're only making
	one item and icon and just shimmying it around

*******************
Long Term Goals
i. 		smooth out the UI 
ii. 	make neat transitions when panels are activated and deactivated
iii.	add the icons for the rest of the items
iv. 	add UI control for handheld device
v. 		add UI control for gamecontroller
vi. 	have timer STOP when excavation is ready
vii.	have visible timers count DOWN instead of up
viii. 	apply proper item, level, and character values
ix. 	create a universal "CreateItem" function, I had one but I ended up losing it in
			making the new ChangeContainer functions
x. 		create a script containing every function for every UI button and have the buttons
			use that
xi. 	create a CONSTANTVALUES.cs script and remove all hard-coded values (trading them out
			for the values in CONSTANTVALUES.cs)
