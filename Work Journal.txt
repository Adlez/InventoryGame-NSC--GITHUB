Treasure Scavenge TO-DO List
-May 29th 2017
----------------
Fixes:
	c. is fixed, ironically a. and b. are still issues.
		The Fix: the issue was two scripts were creating the items, and that there was a 
		function call that added items to the "inventory", using items that didn't have
		the correct function delegation
	There was another issue with the items not being added to inventories correctly.
		The issue was that when an item was added to an inventory it was added to all party's 
		inventories. 
		This was fixed by getting and then setting the inventories in script (ChangeContainer),
			since only most places in the script were "getting" the inventories, but the one place
			that needed it most (the funciton that set the items properly at the end), did not.
			Two new functions were made for clarity and the "Get" is called in nearly every other
			function of the script.

		
Short Term issues:
	a. Excavated Items are only being created once, or just the icons are created once
		something like that. Find the cause of the issue.
	b. Fix a. 
Note: you can find known problems in code by searching for " **FIX** " in the scripts

ChangingContainerScript.cs, just io_CurrentContainer in general, might/should use
	party ID *-2 to identify being in a particular party's stash

Short Term / High Priority goals:
a. excavated items are only showing the one icon again, find the problem
b. fix a.
c. make sure a. isn't also an issue elsewhere, I have a feeling we're only making
	one item and/or icon and just shimmying it around

Icons were "invisible" because they had no Z scale. Problem solved.

*******************
Long Term Goals
i. 		smooth out the UI 
ii. 	make neat transitions when panels are activated and deactivated
iii.	add the icons for the rest of the items
iv. 	add UI control for handheld device
v. 		add UI control for gamecontroller
vi. 	have timer STOP when excavation is ready
vii.	have visible timers count DOWN instead of up
viii. 	apply proper item, level, and character values
ix. 	create a universal "CreateItem" function, I had one but I ended up losing it in
			making the new ChangeContainer functions
x. 		create a script containing every function for every UI button and have the buttons
			use that
xi. 	create a CONSTANTVALUES.cs script and remove all hard-coded values (trading them out
			for the values in CONSTANTVALUES.cs)
