Short Term / High Priority goals:
a. excavated items are only showing the one icon again, find the problem
b. fix a.
c. make sure a. isn't also an issue elsewhere, I have a feeling we're only making
	one item and/or icon and just shimmying it around

Icons were "invisible" because they had no Z scale. Problem solved.

Long Term Goals
i. 		smooth out the UI 
ii. 	make neat transitions when panels are activated and deactivated
iii.	add the icons for the rest of the items
iv. 	add UI control for handheld device

vi. 	have timer STOP when excavation is ready
vii.	have visible timers count DOWN instead of up
viii. 	apply proper item, level, and character values
ix. 	create a universal "CreateItem" function, I had one but I ended up losing it in
			making the new ChangeContainer functions
x. 		create a script containing every function for every UI button and have the buttons
			use that
xi. 	create a CONSTANTVALUES.cs script and remove all hard-coded values (trading them out
			for the values in CONSTANTVALUES.cs)
